d. Develop class Polynomial as follows:
i. It has one field representing the coefficients of the polynomial using an array of
double. A polynomial is assumed to have the form 𝑎 ! + 𝑎" 𝑥 " + ⋯ + 𝑎 #$" 𝑥 #$" .
For example, the polynomial 6 − 2𝑥 + 5𝑥 % would be represented using the
array [6, -2, 0, 5]
ii. It has a no-argument constructor that sets the polynomial to zero (i.e. the
corresponding array would be [0])
iii. It has a constructor that takes an array of double as an argument and sets the
coefficients accordingly
iv. It has a method named add that takes one argument of type Polynomial and
returns the polynomial resulting from adding the calling object and the argument
v. It has a method named evaluate that takes one argument of type double
representing a value of x and evaluates the polynomial accordingly. For example,
if the polynomial is 6 − 2𝑥 + 5𝑥 % and evaluate(-1) is invoked, the result should
be 3.
vi. It has a method named hasRoot that takes one argument of type double and
determines whether this value is a root of the polynomial or not. Note that a root
is a value of x for which the polynomial evaluates to zero.
